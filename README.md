# Resepin

Resepin is the name of an amazing, user-friendly website and dashboard that was created by two students who wanted to showcase their skills and passion for the subject of Web Programming 1. Both the site and Dashboard were built using web technologies including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL to ensure the site is easy to navigate, responsive and secure. 

The main purpose of this website is to offer a wide variety of food recipes from different countries and cultures, with complete information on ingredients, cooking steps. The site also features cool images of the dishes, as well as ratings of other users who have tried them. In addition, there is also information about Resepin, what its vision and mission is, and what benefits it has provided.

The dashboard enables users to perform CRUD operations, which means they would be able to create, read, update and delete any food information they wish. Users can also register and log in to access data on the site as there are login and register features, and the session feature in PHP prevents unauthorised users from accessing certain areas of the site. On the dashboard there is also a search feature that makes it easy to be able to search for recipes based on the name of the food.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download it. Then extract it and place it wherever you want.
2. Make sure the development environment on your computer or laptop has HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Because if one of them is not there, then the results will not run properly later.
3. Afterwards, configure the database. Enter the file called `functions.php` then look at the top. Modify the host, username, password, and database according to your environment.
4. Next, in the zip file there is a `database.sql` file. Use a MySQL client (like PHPMyAdmin) to import this into a MySQL database.
5. When you have done that, all we have to do is run the project. It can be a website or a dashboard.
6. To access the features in the dashboard, we need to register first, then login to be able to access the stuff in it.
7. After everything is done, the project is running perfectly.
